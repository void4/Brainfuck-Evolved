 * Basic Brainfuck Interpreter                                                                               *
 * Written by Kurtis Dinelle (http://kurtisdinelle.com)                                                      *
 *                                                                                                           *
 * A simple brainfuck interpreter written to be used only with the Brainfuck Evolved program.                *
 * Therefore, this interpreter does not include features a complete interpreter would have (such as input).  *
 *                                                                                                           *
 * Since brainfuck isn't fully defined, some assumptions had to be made:                                     *
 *                                                                                                           *
 *      -The size of the 'tape' holding cells will be fixed-length (1000 cells, chosesn arbitrarily).        *
 *      -Each cell can hold an unsigned char (so up to a value of 255). Going over will cause wrap-around.   *
 *      -Going outside the bounds of a type's size is actually undefined behavior in C++,                    *
 *       however most implementations handle this via wrap-around. This interpreter relies on such behavior. *
